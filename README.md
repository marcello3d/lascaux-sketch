## About

Lascaux Sketch was originally a Java Applet I wrote back in [2002](https://web.archive.org/web/20041009175410/http://www.cellosoft.com/sketchstudio/)
used on [2draw.net](https://2draw.net/). This is a new version built from the ground up using TypeScript and WebGL.

## Main features

- Multiple layers
- Hardware accelerated
  - Float32/float16 RGBA where supported (much higher quality color blending)
- Saves in browser local storage
- Full replayable animation history
